Props is short for properties and they are used to pass data between React components. React’s data flow between components is uni-directional (from parent to child only).Firstly, we need to define/get some data from the parent component and assign it to a child component’s “prop” attribute.“Name” is a defined prop here and contains text data. Then we can pass data with props And finally, we use dot notation to access the prop data and render it.
React has another special built-in object called state, which allows components to create and manage their own data. So unlike props, components cannot pass data with state, but they can create and manage it internally.tate should not be modified directly, but it can be modified with a special method called setState( ). Change in the state happens based on user-input, triggering an event, and so on. Also, React components (with state) are rendered based on the data in the state. State holds the initial information.
